Hi there! I'm Bryan Buchs, a web developer with nearly three decades of experience crafting accessible, responsive, and user-friendly digital experiences.{.popout .text-huge .text-center}

I've been building websites since, well, pretty much since there's been an internet. I started my journey in the mid-90s when I discovered "View Source" in Netscape Navigator, and I was instantly hooked. Throughout my career, I've transformed alongside the web itself. While HTML remains the faithful constant in my toolkit, I've continuously embraced new technologiesâ€”from the early days of table-based layouts to today's modern frameworks like Vue.js.

I've had the privilege of building solutions for amazing organizations like Stanford University, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, PBS, as well as other arts and educational institutions. My passion lies in creating websites that everyone can use, regardless of ability. That's why I've championed WCAG accessibility standards across all projects.

Here's a showcase of my favorite projects from my time at [kapow, inc](https://kapowinc.com){target='_blank'}. Each of these sites presented unique challenges that pushed my skills as a developer and resulted in work I'm truly proud of. Click through to dive deeper into the details and see what went into creating these digital experiences.

When I'm not crafting clean code or optimizing performance, you'll find me exploring the latest web technologies. My current tech stack includes vanilla Javascript for basic interactivity, Vue.js for single-page apps and data-driven interactive pieces, Drupal for content management, and a development workflow powered by Vite, LESS, and PostCSS. I've developed my own [Drupal theme methodology](https://github.com/bryanbuchs/drupal-theme) utilizing Storybook for component development and documentation, and a [command line generator](https://github.com/bryanbuchs/generator-component) to streamline the process of creating new components.
