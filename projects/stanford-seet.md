# Stanford Enterprise Education for Transformation

For the Stanford Enterprise Education website, I took on the complete development responsibility, handling both frontend and backend work for this Drupal-powered marketing site. Working from designer comps, I transformed static designs into a fully responsive, accessible website that showcases Stanford’s Enterprise Education programs at the intersection of strategy, technology, and people. This project gave me the opportunity to refine my component-driven development approach, leaning heavily on Storybook to create a robust library of reusable elements.

One of the aspects I’m most proud of is the themable content components (Drupal Paragraphs) that give content editors exceptional flexibility while maintaining design consistency. This modular approach allows the marketing team to create compelling, visually distinct sections without developer intervention. The work on this project actually inspired me to extract my approach into open-source tools - my own Drupal theme build process and component generator, both now available on GitHub. By focusing on accessibility from the ground up and creating intuitive admin interfaces, the site not only looks great but empowers Stanford’s team to effectively communicate their unique programs for organizational transformation.
