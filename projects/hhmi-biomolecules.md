# Biomolecules on the Menu

I developed 'Biomolecules on the Menu', an immersive educational Vue single-page application that takes students on a journey through the human digestive system. This interactive experience explains the complex connections between food, digestion, metabolism, and cellular respiration in an engaging, visual way. Working with HHMI BioInteractive's science education team, I transformed complex biological concepts into an intuitive digital experience that progressively zooms in from whole-body systems to cellular processes.

I built the entire experience with Vue.js, creating rich SVG-based visualizations animated with the GSAP library to bring biological processes to life. These smooth, responsive animations help students visualize abstract concepts like nutrient absorption and ATP production. By optimizing performance and maintaining accessibility standards, I delivered an interactive learning tool that makes complex science approachable and engaging for students across different devices commonly found in classroom settings.
