# HHMI BioInteractive Video Builder Tool

I helped develop the frontend for BioInteractive’s Interactive Video Builder, an educational tool that transforms science videos into engaging learning experiences. The platform allows educators to enhance HHMI’s video library with pause points, questions, and text annotations at specific timestamps. I created an intuitive interface where teachers can easily add multiple-choice questions, true/false prompts, or free-text responses that appear at precise moments throughout the videos.

For the student experience, I built a custom Vue application that interfaces with the H5P Player to capture responses and generate downloadable PDF summaries. This transforms passive video watching into an interactive assessment tool for educators. The entire system is WCAG AA compliant, fully responsive, and features robust keyboard navigation. I implemented full multilingual support with Spanish translations throughout the site, ensuring the tool is accessible to a wider audience of educators and students worldwide.
